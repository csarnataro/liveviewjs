## LiveViewJS

### *Front-end framework for back-end developers*

### Credit üôå
This is a backend implementation of [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) in Typescript.  What the Phoenix folks have built is phenominal and I wanted to use that paradigm in Typescript and make it available to others.

### Quick Overview of LiveView Approach
How Phoenix desribes LiveView:
> LiveView is an exciting new library which enables rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML. LiveView powered applications are stateful on the server with bidrectional communication via WebSockets, offering a vastly simplified programming model compared to JavaScript alternatives.

In other words, LiveView takes a very different approach than the popular SPA frameworks like React, Vuejs, and Svelt to building rich, highly interactive web applications.  Instead of sending down a bundle of javascript, LiveView apps render an HTML page on the first request and then connect via a persistent socket over which client events are sent and updated received.  These events may trigger a state update on the server and a re-calculation of what the page should look like.  Instead of reloading the page, the client receives a "diff" of the page via the socket and the page's DOM is updated.  See a detailed [sequence diagram of the client/server lifecycle](docs/liveview_lifecycle.md).

The programming paradigm is extremely powerful and productive!

### Feedback is a üéÅ
Please feel free to open an issue with questions, bugs, etc.

### Status - **Œ≤**
LiveViewJS is in Œ≤eta. The project is still young but the code is stable, tested, and well-documented.

### Implemented Phoenix Bindings
The bindings below marked with ‚úÖ are working and tested and most of them have example usage in the `examples` codebase.  Those with `?`, I have not gotten around to testing so not sure if they work. Those marked with ‚ùå are not yet implemented and known not to work.

(See [Phoenix Bindings Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/bindings.html) for more details)

#### LiveViewJS Changesets
Phoenix's Ecto ORM library and Phoenix LiveView rely on [Ecto Changesets](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Changeset.html) to allow filtering, validation, and other logic to be applied to the data.  Changesets are a powerful way to apply logic to data and are used in Phoenix's ORM and LiveView.  LiveViewJS uses Changesets to provide a similar API to Phoenix's though it is NOT a full-blown ORM.

Detailed documentation on [LiveViewJS Changesets](docs/changesets.md).

### Usage - Show me some code! ‚å®Ô∏è

**Step 0** Install LiveViewJS
`npm i liveviewjs`

**Step 1** Implement a `LiveViewComponent`
```ts
import { SessionData } from "express-session";
import { BaseLiveView, html, LiveViewContext, LiveViewExternalEventListener, LiveViewMeta, LiveViewMountParams, LiveViewSocket, LiveViewTemplate } from "liveviewjs";

// describe the context (i.e. state of the view)
interface ClickDemoContext extends LiveViewContext{
  count: number;
}
type MyEvent = "user-clicked";
// implement the LiveView
export class ClickDemo extends BaseLiveView<ClickDemoContext, never> implements
// add listener for external events
LiveViewExternalEventListener<ClickDemoContext, MyEvent, never>{

  // mount only called once per http request and per socket connection
  mount(params: LiveViewMountParams, session: Partial<SessionData>, socket: LiveViewSocket<ClickDemoContext>){
    socket.assign({count: 0}); // set initial count to 0
  }

  // render the LiveView content (called each time an event is received)
  render(context: ClickDemoContext, meta: LiveViewMeta): LiveViewTemplate | Promise<LiveViewTemplate> {
    const { count } = context;
    return html`
      <h2>Click Demo</h2>
      <button phx-click="${MyEvent}" type="button">Click to Increment</button>
      <p><strong>Count:</strong>${count}</p>
    `
  }

  // handle user interactions from client
  handleEvent(event: MyEvent, params: never, socket: LiveViewSocket<ClickDemoContext>): void | Promise<void> {
    socket.assign({count: socket.context.count + 1}); // increment count
  }

}
```

**Step 2** - Register your `LiveViewComponent`s and start the server with `LiveViewServer`
```ts
// import package
import {LiveViewServer} from "liveviewjs";

// create new LiveViewServer
const server = new LiveViewServer();

// define your routes by mapping paths to LiveViewComponents
const router: LiveViewRouter = {
  "/clickdemo": new ClickDemo();
}
// AND then passing the router to the server
server.registerLiveViewRoutes(router);

// OR register your route with the server directly
// server.registerLiveViewRoute("/clickdemo", new ClickDemo());

// then start the server
server.start();
```

### NPM Commands
`npm i` - install the deps

`npm run build` - builds the framework, client, and examples (server)

`npm run watch` - continually rebuilds the codebase when files are updated

`npm run examples` - runs the examples [See `src/examples`]

`npm run test` - runs the (few) tests

### Run and Browse Examples
**Credit**: These examples are adapted from an amazing [Phoenix Video / Code Course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/phoenix-liveview) authored by the folks at [Pragmatic Studio](https://pragmaticstudio.com/).

Navigate to `src/examples` to see the example code.

Run `npm run examples` then point your browser to:
 * `http://localhost:4444/` - Shows the index of all the examples

 There is also a standalone [TodoMVC](https://github.com/floodfx/todomvc-liveviewjs) example application written in LiveViewJS.

### More Details on the Approach to Building LiveViewJS üìê

 * **Reuse Phoenix Client Libraries and app.js code** - The Phoenix team has done a ton of heavy lifting on the client that we can just use.  We also benefit from fixes and improvements in the future.  [See `src/client/liveview.ts` for client code.]

 * **Reuse Phoenix socket message protocol** - The Phoenix team already figured out a great protocol to send events to/from the server.  We just implemented a different backend.

 * **Follow component API design (i.e. `mount`, `render` etc), reimplemented with Typescript (so even more type-safe)** - Components in LiveViewJS follow the `mount`, `render`, `handleEvent`, and `handleInfo` API defined in Phoenix. Again, no need to invent a new API.

### Gratitude üôè
Thanks to [@ogrodnek](https://github.com/ogrodnek) for the early support, feedback, and the idea to reuse the Phoenix client code instead of reinventing!

Thanks to [@blimmer](https://github.com/blimmer/) for the awesome feedback, documentation suggests, and support!
