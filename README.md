## LiveViewJS

### *Front-end framework for back-end developers*

### Credit üôå
This is a backend implementation of [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) in Typescript.  What the Phoenix folks have built is phenominal and I wanted to use that paradigm in Typescript and make it available to others.

### Quick Overview of LiveView Approach
How Phoenix desribes LiveView:
> LiveView is an exciting new library which enables rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML. LiveView powered applications are stateful on the server with bidrectional communication via WebSockets, offering a vastly simplified programming model compared to JavaScript alternatives.

In other words, LiveView takes a very different approach than the popular SPA frameworks like React, Vuejs, and Svelt to building rich, highly interactive web applications.  Instead of sending down a bundle of javascript, LiveView apps render an HTML page on the first request and then connect via a persistent socket over which client events are sent and updated received.  These events may trigger a state update on the server and a re-calculation of what the page should look like.  Instead of reloading the page, the client receives a "diff" of the page via the socket and the page's DOM is updated.

The programming paradigm is extremely powerful and productive!

### Feedback is a üéÅ
Please feel free to open an issue with questions, bugs, etc.

### Status - **Œ≤**
LiveViewJS is in Œ≤eta. The project is still young but the code is stable, tested, and well-documented.

### Implemented Phoenix Bindings
The bindings below marked with ‚úÖ are working and tested and most of them have example usage in the `examples` codebase.  Those with `?`, I have not gotten around to testing so not sure if they work. Those marked with ‚ùå are not yet implemented and known not to work.

#### LiveViewJS Changesets
Phoenix's Ecto ORM library and Phoenix LiveView rely on [Ecto Changesets](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Changeset.html) to allow filtering, validation, and other logic to be applied to the data.  Changesets are a powerful way to apply logic to data and are used in Phoenix's ORM and LiveView.  LiveViewJS uses Changesets to provide a similar API to Phoenix's though it is NOT a full-blown ORM.

Detailed documentation on [LiveViewJS Changesets](docs/changesets.md).

### Usage - Show me some code! ‚å®Ô∏è

**Step 0** Install LiveViewJS
`npm i liveviewjs`

**Step 1** Implement a `LiveViewComponent`
```ts
import { SessionData } from "express-session";
import {html, BaseLiveViewComponent, LiveViewComponent, LiveViewExternalEventListener, LiveViewMountParams, LiveViewSocket } from "liveviewjs";

// define your component's data shape
export interface LightContext {
  brightness: number;
}

// define the component events
export type LightEvent = "on" | "off" | "up" | "down";

// implement your component
export class LightLiveViewComponent extends BaseLiveViewComponent<LightContext, never> implements
  LiveViewComponent<LightContext, never>,
  LiveViewExternalEventListener<LightContext, LightEvent, never> {

  // mount is called before html render on HTTP requests and
  // when the socket is connected on the phx-join event
  mount(params: LiveViewMountParams, session: Partial<SessionData>, socket: LiveViewSocket<LightContext>) {
    // set the default value(s) for the component data
    return { brightness: 10 };
  };

  // Define and render the HTML for your LiveViewComponent
  // This function is called after any context change and
  // only diffs are sent back to the page to re-render
  render(context: LightContext) {
    const { brightness } = context;
    return html`
    <div id="light">
      <h1>Front Porch Light </h1>
      <div class="meter">
        <div>${brightness}%</div>
        <progress id="light_level" value="${brightness}" max="100">
        </progress>
      </div>

      <button phx-click="off">
        Off
      </button>

      <button phx-click="down">
        Down
      </button>

      <button phx-click="up">
        Up
      </button>

      <button phx-click="on">
        On
      </button>
    </div>
    `
  };

  // Handle events sent back from the client...  Events
  // may update the state (context) of the component and
  // cause a re-render
  handleEvent(event: LightEvent, params: never, socket: LiveViewSocket<LightContext>) {
    const ctx: LightContext = { brightness: socket.context.brightness };
    switch (event) {
      case 'off':
        ctx.brightness = 0;
        break;
      case 'on':
        ctx.brightness = 100;
        break;
      case 'up':
        ctx.brightness = Math.min(ctx.brightness + 10, 100);
        break;
      case 'down':
        ctx.brightness = Math.max(ctx.brightness - 10, 0);
        break;
    }
    return ctx;
  }

}
```

**Step 2** - Register your `LiveViewComponent`s and start the HTTP and Socket server with `LiveViewServer`
```ts
// import package
import {LiveViewServer} from "liveviewjs";

// create new LiveViewServer
const lvServer = new LiveViewServer();

// define your routes by mapping paths to LiveViewComponents
const lvRouter: LiveViewRouter = {
  "/light": new LightLiveViewComponent();
}
// AND then passing the router to the server
lvServer.registerLiveViewRoutes(lvRouter);

// OR register your route with the server directly
lvServer.registerLiveViewRoute("/light", new LightLiveViewComponent());

// then start the server
lvServer.start();
```

 There is also a standalone [TodoMVC](https://github.com/floodfx/todomvc-liveviewjs) example application written in LiveViewJS.

### More Details on the Approach to Building LiveViewJS üìê

 * **Reuse Phoenix Client Libraries and app.js code** - The Phoenix team has done a ton of heavy lifting on the client that we can just use.  We also benefit from fixes and improvements in the future.  [See `src/client/liveview.ts` for client code.]

 * **Reuse Phoenix socket message protocol** - The Phoenix team already figured out a great protocol to send events to/from the server.  We just implemented a different backend.

 * **Follow component API design (i.e. `mount`, `render` etc), reimplemented with Typescript (so even more type-safe)** - Components in LiveViewJS follow the `mount`, `render`, `handleEvent`, and `handleInfo` API defined in Phoenix. Again, no need to invent a new API.

### Gratitude üôè
Thanks to [@ogrodnek](https://github.com/ogrodnek) for the early support, feedback, and the idea to reuse the Phoenix client code instead of reinventing!

Thanks to [@blimmer](https://github.com/blimmer/) for the awesome feedback, documentation suggests, and support!
